IOS has several important points, so I hope you can look at this document before using the module ! Learning by heart.

(suitable for Apple 4s/ 5/ 5s)

IOS usage:

1.IOS search for Bluetooth, not in Settings -¡·Bluetooth search and pairing Bluetooth. (IOS settings can only connect Bluetooth headset. Can not find the wireless data device)

2.IOS search for LightBlue software in Appstore, and then open the LightBlue software to search for HM-10, to pair and to test send and receive!

---------------------------------------------

Android phone

1. First, confirm whether the Bluetooth module on Android mobile phone supports Bluetooth 4.0 (if not supporting, the software does not work properly!)

2. System is upgraded to 4.3 or later

3. HMBLEComAssistant.rar inside data package can be used to test the transceiver

-------------- For HM-10 module configuration, you need USB to TTL device. Not wireless pairing is configured! (Because wireless pairing, the data directly through the transmission)

1. The LED flashes slowly when it is not paired with the remote device. At this time, you can use the AT command to configure the module.

2.HM-10 module can only recognize all uppercase AT command, does not support lowercase or mixture of uppercase and lowercase.

3. The factory default baud rate is 9600 8n1
